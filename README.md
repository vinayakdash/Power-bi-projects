# Power BI - Data Visualization  
# Pizza Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of a pizza sales dataset for a fictional pizza chain. The analysis leverages Power BI to extract key business insights, visualize performance trends, and support data-driven decision-making.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is a fictional pizza sales dataset. It comprises four interrelated tables:
* `orders` – details about each customer order including timestamps.
* `order_details` – breakdowns of each order by specific pizzas and quantities purchased.
* `pizzas` – price and size information for each pizza item.
* `pizza_types` – descriptions of each pizza by name, category (e.g., Classic, Veggie), and ingredients.

## Features
* Comprehensive visual dashboards for data aggregation and analysis.
* Insights into daily revenue trends, top-selling pizzas, category performance, and more.
* Demonstrates skills in data modeling, Power Query transformations, DAX measures, and interactive visual storytelling.

## Requirements
* Power BI Desktop installed.
* The provided pizza sales dataset and `.pbix` dashboard file.

## Usage
* Open the `Pizza_Sales_Data_Visualisation.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
* Ensure the CSV files are in the same directory if reconnection is needed.
* Explore the report to gain insights into pizza sales performance.

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational and portfolio purposes only. The dataset is fictional, and any resemblance to real business data is purely coincidental.
